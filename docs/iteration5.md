# Wireframe & Use-case

# Iteration Backlog
- As a user, I want to submit a "play-along" to another user's 1) uploaded personal audio/video 2) song-of-the-week submissions
- As a user, I want to be able to register with an email/password so that I can still use the app even if I don't have a Spotify account.

Previously postponed user stories:
- As a student user, I would like to verify my college enrollment with a .edu email so I can filter and find other students on my campus and at nearby schools.
- As an admin, i want to enable RSVP functionality for the speed-dating events and set visibilty to all registered users, so that only registered users can attend the events.

- Design wireframs for:
  1. Submitting "play-alongs" to song-of-the-week and user's personal audio/videos

  3. As a student user, filtering by students on my school's campus
- Overhaul frontend 
- Improve error handling to prevent multiple state updates
