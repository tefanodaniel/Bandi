# Wireframe & Use-case

Use Case: Making a song-of-the-week challenge submission
1. A user navigates to the Song of the Week page.
2. The user is presented with the song of the week and the current submissions.
3. If they click on another user's submission, they will be redirected to the submission link.
4. If they click on "Add your submission!", they will be prompted to post their submission link.

Use Case: Submitting a play-along
1. The user navigates to another profile.
2. The user is presented with a series of videos or links that the second user has chosen to share.
3. The user can record and upload a play-along to their own profile.

# Iteration Backlog
- As a user, I want to submit a "play-along" to another user's 1) uploaded personal audio/video 2) song-of-the-week submissions
- As a user, I want to be able to display my recent Spotify top tracks on my profile so that others may know what kind of music I enjoy.

Postponed/Scrapped:
- As as user, I want to be able to register with an email/password so that I can still use the app even if I don't have a Spotify account.

# Tasks
- Design UML class diagrams for implementing User Stories
- Design wireframes for:
  1. Submitting "play-alongs" to song-of-the-week and user's personal audio/videos
- Overhaul frontend 
- Improve error handling to prevent multiple state updates
- Continue debugging to achieve faster execution of app
- Add Spotify listening history, .edu verification, and login for non-Spotify users.
- Test and Deploy
