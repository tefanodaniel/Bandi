# Wireframe & Use-case

# Iteration Backlog
- As a user, I want to be able to display my recent Spotify top tracks on my profile so that others may know what kind of music I enjoy.

Postponed/Scrapped:
- As as user, I want to be able to register with an email/password so that I can still use the app even if I don't have a Spotify account.
- As a user, I want to submit a "play-along" to another user's 1) uploaded personal audio/video 2) song-of-the-week submission

# Tasks
- Design UML class diagrams for implementing User Stories
- Overhaul frontend 
- Improve error handling to prevent multiple state updates
- Continue debugging to achieve faster execution of app
- Add Spotify listening history.
- Test and Deploy
