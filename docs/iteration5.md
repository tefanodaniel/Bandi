# Wireframe & Use-case

Use Case: Display Spotify top tracks
1. A user selects another user's profile to view.
2. The second user's top tracks from their most recent listening history is displayed on that user's page.

# Iteration Backlog
- As a user, I want to be able to display my recent Spotify top tracks on my profile so that others may know what kind of music I enjoy.

Postponed/Scrapped:
- As as user, I want to be able to register with an email/password so that I can still use the app even if I don't have a Spotify account.
- As a user, I want to submit a "play-along" to another user's 1) uploaded personal audio/video 2) song-of-the-week submission

# Tasks
- Design UML class diagrams for implementing User Stories
- Overhaul frontend 
- Improve error handling to prevent multiple state updates
- Continue debugging to achieve faster execution of app
- Add Spotify listening history.
- Test and Deploy

- Troubleshooting bugs from previous iterations
- Added unit tests to the backend
- Implemented search functionality for bands browse
- Implemented advanced search for musicians
- Implemented adding links to a profile
#### What we haven't done
- Adding in login for users who don't have a Spotify account (scrapped user story)
- Adding in verification for student users (scrapped user story)
- Submitting a play-along to another user's song-of-the-week submission
#### Difficulties
- Editing the styling for all pages in the web app
- Running updated backend and frontend at the same time
