# Project Requirement Specification

## Problem Statement

Finding musicians to play with can be extraordinarily difficult, especially when trying to match factors such as experience level, instrument coverage, and music taste. In college, there may be music organizations on campus that allow students to participate in the music scene, but these groups often have high barriers to entry and do not offer comprehensive networking opportunities. While online platforms exist to faciliate musical networking in the public sphere, there is no comprehensive solution designed for college students, who have different needs and means than the average adult musician.

## Potential Clients
Potential clients include college-age musicians looking to start a band or join an existing one, 
general users without a profile who just want to browse profiles and events, and young
musicians looking to socialize with people with common interests.

## Proposed Solution

Our proposed solution is a web application that allows college students to create profiles that represent their musical interests and what kind of opportunities they are interested in pursuing. This application will allow them to easily find and connect with musicians with similar musical tastes who are also looking for bandmates. Once multiple people have connected, they can create a united profile for their band to make it easier to target musicians to fill their specific areas of need. The application will also facilitate networking events designed to provide musicians opportunities to socialize, identify potential collaborators, and connect with the commnunity.

## Functional Requirements

## Software Architecture & Technology Stack
We feel that a web-application is best for this design. We will use the
client-server model. We want to create a backend in {TODO: Java/Python}, and Heroku
PostgreSQL for a relational database.

TODO: Heroku for production db, but what about a dev db?
