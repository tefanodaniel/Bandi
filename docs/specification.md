# Project Requirement Specification

## Problem Statement



## Potential Clients
Potential clients include college-age musicians looking for bandmates or a band to join,
general users without a profile who just want to browse profiles and events, and young
musicians looking to socialize with people with common interests.

## Proposed Solution



## Functional Requirements 

**Must-have**


**Nice-to-have**



## Software Architecture & Technology Stack
We feel that a web-application is best for this design. We will use the
client-server model. We want to create a backend in Java/Python, and Heroku
Postgres/SQL for a relational database.
