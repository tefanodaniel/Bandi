# Project Backlog

## Iteration 1 
- As a user, I would like to be able to use my Spotify account for single sign-on so I can display portions of my listening history on my profile.
- As a user, I want to be able to create a visible profile with my name, instrument, experience level, 
  and musical taste so that  I can meet people with similar interests.
- As a band member, I want to be able to create a profile on the app for my band so that we can easily search for additional musicians as a single entity.

## Iteration 2
- As a user, I want to be able to filter profiles based on a set of similar interests and/or geographic proximity to me so that I can connect with those users.
- As a band member, I want to be able to link my and my bandmates' personal profiles to the band profile so that prospective musicians can easily learn about the band and its members.
- As a user and as a band member, I would like to be able to put links to audio/video clips (YouTube, Soundcloud, etc.) on my profiles so I can give prospective collaborators a preview of my playing.
- As a guest without login credentials, I want to have view-only privileges for the available profiles 
  so that I can see what kind of musicians and groups are around.

## Iteration 3
- As a user, I want to be able to chat with other users that I connect with so that we can discuss our tastes, see if we are a good fit, and arrange to meet in person without having to exchange personal contact information.
- As a user, I want to be able to save the profiles of people I meet in the app so that I can connect with them later.
- As an admin, I want to create speed-dating-like events to send participants into different chatrooms (zoom) where they can chat for a short amount of time before moving on to the next chosen match, so that users can have a fun way of meeting a lot of people in a short amount of time.
- As an admin, I want to set the time and date of speed-dating events, as well as the minimum number of users that must register themselves for an event before the virtual chatrooms are opened/created, to ensure that events will have a good user turnout.
- As an admin, I want to create "song-of-the-week" events that chooses a song high in the latest charts. The event has description or information about the song and an option for users to submit youtube/soundcloud links (capped to 1-2 mins)

## Iteration 4
- As a user, I want to be able to browse and register for speed-dating events that are happening in my area so that I can quickly meet a lot of people with similar interests and see if we might be a good match.
- As a user, I want to browse song-of-the-week events by genre and make submissions. 
- As a band member, I want to be able to send an invite to other registered users to join my band profile.
- As a student user, I would like to verify my college enrollment with an .edu email so I can filter and find other students on my campus and at nearby schools.
- As an admin, I want to enable RSVP functionality for the speed-dating events and set visibility to all registered users, so that only registered users can attend the events.

## Iteration 5
- As a user, I want to submit a "play-along" to another user's 1) uploaded personal audio/video 2) song-of-the-week submissions
- As a user, I want to be able to register with an email/password so that I can still use the app even if I don't have a Spotify account.





---CUT USER STORIES---
- As a user, I want to see where other musicians are located on a geographic map of my city or town so that I have a better idea of who's playing what in my area.
(isn't this the same as geographical proximity search in Iteration 2)

- As a user, I want to receive email confirmation of my registration for an event so that I can have email confirmation of my registration for the event.

- As a user, I want the option to receive an email reminder a customizable amount of time before the event so that I can remember to attend.

  

- As a band member, I would like to be able to create and customize an application portal for virtual tryouts, so that musicians interested in joining my band can submit recordings/videos of themselves playing their instrument.
- As a user, I want to be able to specifically browse for bands with virtual tryouts so I can easily find them and apply.



- As a guest, I want to be able to browse band profiles and use a “contact us” form to ask about their availability for gigs so that I can hire local bands to play events.
