# Project Backlog

## Iteration 1
- As a user, I want to be able to create a visible profile with my name, instrument, experience level, 
  and musical taste so that I can meet people with similar interests.
- As a guest without login credentials, I want to have view-only privileges for the available profiles 
  so that I can see what kind of musicians and groups are around.

## Iteration 2
- As a user, I want to be able to filter profiles based on a set of similar interests and/or geographic proximity to me so that I can connect with those users.
- As a guest, I want to be able to browse band profiles and use a “contact us” form to ask about their availability for gigs so that I can hire local bands to play events.
- As a band member, I want to be able to create a profile on the app for my band so that we can easily search for additional musicians as a single entity.
- As a band member, I want to be able to link my and my bandmates' personal profiles to the band profile so that prospective musicians can easily learn about the band and its members.

## Iteration 3
- As a user, I want to be able to chat with other users that I connect with so that we can discuss our tastes, see if we are a good fit, and arrange to meet in person without having to exchange personal contact information.
- As a user, I want to be able to save the profiles of people I meet in the app so that I can connect with them later.
- As a user, I want to be able to browse speed-dating events that are happening in my area so that I can register for an event that works with my schedule.
- As a user, I want to be able to join matchmaking events so that I can quickly meet a lot of people with similar interests and see if we might be a good match.

## Iteration 4
- As a user, I would like to be able to sign in with my Spotify account to display portions of my listening history on my profile.
- As a band member, I want to be able to send an invite to other registered users to join my band profile.
- As a student user, I would like to verify my college enrollment with an .edu email so I can filter and find other students on my campus.
- As an admin, I want to be able to create speed-dating-like events to send participants into different chatrooms where they can chat for a short amount of time before moving on to the next chosen match, so that users can have a fun way of meeting a lot of people in a short amount of time.
- As an admin, I want to enable RSVP functionality for these events and set visibility to all registered users, so that only registered users can attend the events.
- As an admin, I want to set the time and date of speed-dating events, as well as the minimum number of users that must register themselves for an event before the virtual chatrooms are opened/created, to ensure that events will have a good user turnout.
- As a user, I want to receive email confirmation of my registration for an event so that I can have email confirmation of my registration for the event.
- As a user, I want the option to receive an email reminder a customizable amount of time before the event so that I can remember to attend.

## Iteration 5
- As a user and as a band member, I would like to be able to put audio/video clips on my profiles so I can give prospective collaborators a preview of my playing.
- As a user, I want to see where other musicians are located on a geographic map of my city or town so that I have a better idea of who's playing what in my area.
- As a band member, I would like to be able to create and customize an application portal for virtual tryouts, so that musicians interested in joining my band can submit recordings/videos of themselves playing their instrument.
- As a user, I want to be able to specifically browse for bands with virtual tryouts so I can easily find them and apply.
