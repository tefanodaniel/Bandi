User Case: Invite to Band
  1. A user browses through the profiles of other musicians and selects one to view in more depth.
  2. The user clicks the "Invite to Band!" button and waits for the request to be accepted by the other user.
  3. Once accepted, the invited user will display as a member of the band.
# Iteration Backlog
- As a user, I want to be able to browse and register for speed-dating events that are happening in my area so that I can quickly meet a lot of people with similar interests and see if we might be a good match.
- As a user, I want to browse song-of-the-week events by genre and make submissions.
- As a band member, I want to be able to send an invite to other registered users to join my band profile.
- As a student user, I would like to verify my college enrollment with an .edu email so I can filter and find other students on my campus and at nearby schools.
- As an admin, I want to enable RSVP functionality for the speed-dating events and set visibility to all registered users, so that only registered users can attend the events.
